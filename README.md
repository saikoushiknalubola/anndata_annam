**Soil Image Classification – IIT Ropar x Annam.ai Hackathon 2025**

This project is developed as part of the Hackathon and Internship opportunity organized by IIT Ropar and Annam.ai. It focuses on classifying soil types (Alluvial, Black, Clay, Red) from images using deep learning techniques to contribute towards AI-driven sustainable agriculture.

**Repository Structure:**

* /src → Source code modules (models, utils, dataloaders)
* /notebooks → Jupyter Notebooks for training and inference

  * training.ipynb
  * inference.ipynb
* /docs/architecture.png → Model architecture or system overview
* /docs/cards/project-card.ipynb → Project overview notebook
* /docs/cards/ml-metrics.json → Classification performance metrics
* /data/download.sh → Script to download/prepare the dataset
* README.md → Project documentation
* requirements.txt → Python package dependencies

**Setup Instructions:**

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/saikoushiknalubola/anndata_annam

2. Navigate into the project folder:
   cd soil-classification-hackathon

3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate (use env\Scripts\activate on Windows)
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. (Optional) Run the data/download.sh script to prepare your dataset.

**Run Instructions:**

* For training: open and execute `notebooks/training.ipynb`
* For inference and submission: run `notebooks/inference.ipynb`

**Model Highlights:**

* Uses CNN-based transfer learning (EfficientNet, ResNet, etc.)
* Applies data augmentation and test-time augmentation (TTA)
* Implements stratified K-fold cross-validation
* Uses ensemble methods for improved accuracy

**Evaluation:**

Classification accuracy is the primary metric. Refer to the `ml-metrics.json` file for detailed results and `architecture.png` for the model overview.
