# ğŸŒ± Soil Image Classification Challenge â€” Project Card

## ğŸ“˜ Summary

This project addresses the **Soil Image Classification Challenge** hosted by Annam.ai at IIT Ropar.

The task is to classify soil images into one of the following four categories:

- **Alluvial soil**
- **Black soil**
- **Clay soil**
- **Red soil**

We built a deep learning pipeline using a **ResNet-50** backbone with cross-validation,  
Albumentations-based data augmentation, and test-time augmentation (TTA),  
targeting the **minimum per-class F1-score** â€” the official competition metric.
