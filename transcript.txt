Hello, and welcome to the demo of my soil classification project.

In this project, I worked on classifying soil images into four categories: Alluvial Soil, Black Soil, Clay Soil, and Red Soil. The main objective was to predict the soil type from image data using machine learning techniques.

The dataset provided included a set of training images with known labels and a separate test set without labels. The training labels were available in a CSV file, and the test image IDs were listed separately.

For feature extraction, I used a pre-trained ResNet18 model from PyTorch. I stripped off the final fully connected layer so the model would act purely as a feature extractor, generating fixed-length feature vectors from the images. Each image was resized to 224x224 pixels before feeding it into ResNet18.

After extracting the features, I trained a Random Forest classifier to perform the actual classification. I chose this hybrid approach because it combines the strong feature extraction capabilities of deep learning with the interpretability and solid performance of classical machine learning models.

To evaluate performance, I ran a 5-fold stratified cross-validation and achieved an average macro F1 score of about 0.955 — which shows that the model performed well and fairly across all soil types.

Finally, I retrained the model on the full training dataset and generated predictions on the test set. I mapped the predicted labels back to the original soil type names using label encoding and prepared the final submission CSV.

Thanks for following along with this demo! Let me know if you’d like to dive deeper into any part of the process.
